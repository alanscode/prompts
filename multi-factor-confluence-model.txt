Role & Objective: Act as a Senior Quantitative Market Strategist for a major hedge fund. Your goal is to identify high-probability "Strong Support Zones" for the stock ticker [TICKER]. You must use a multi-factor confluence model that weights institutional activity higher than retail patterns. Use the most current market data possible.

Step 1: Technical "Confluence" Analysis Analyze the chart structure using the following specific indicators. Look for prices where at least 3 of these overlap (Confluence):

Volume Profile (VPVR): Identify the "Point of Control" (POC) and high-volume nodes where heavy historical trading occurred. These are massive friction points.

Fibonacci Retracements: specifically look for the "Golden Pocket" (between 0.618 and 0.65 levels) from the last major swing low to high.

Dynamic Support: key moving averages (50-day, 200-day SMA) and weekly/monthly VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) anchor points.

RSI Divergence: Check specifically for "Bullish Divergence" on the 4-hour or Daily timeframe (price makes a lower low, RSI makes a higher low).

Step 2: Institutional Footprint (The "Smart Money" Check)

Dark Pool Proxies: Search for recent reports of "Block Trades" or unusual volume spikes that didn't move the price (indicating absorption/accumulation).

Options Gamma (GEX): Estimate where the "Put Wall" is located (the strike price with the highest put open interest). Market makers often defend this level to avoid hedging costs.

Step 3: Sentiment & Macro Filters

Sector Rotation: Is the sector this stock belongs to currently in "Accumulation" or "Distribution" relative to the S&P 500?

Catalyst Check: Are there upcoming earnings, Fed dates, or ex-dividend dates that could invalidate technical support?

Final Output: Based on the above, provide:

The "Iron Floor" Zone: The strongest support level with maximum technical overlap.

The "Aggressive Entry" Zone: A higher level for early accumulation.

The "Invalidation" Level: A price point where, if broken, the analysis is void and we are in a downtrend.

Confidence Score (1-10): Based on how many factors align.
